COS30049 – Computer Technology (Swinburne University)

Distinction (78) – Semester Project

This repository showcases my work for COS30049 – Computer Technology at Swinburne University. The unit covered core computer architecture concepts, low-level programming, networking, and operating systems.

Most of the work was completed independently and reflects my technical understanding of hardware-software interaction, memory management, instruction sets, and system-level programming.
